An extension for Visual Studio 2022 that provides a development environment for Z80 Assembler, currently targeting a simulator for the ZX Spectrum 48K computer. The extension includes a Project System (what you see in the Solution Explorer window), a Debug Engine (what Visual Studio uses when you start debugging), and a simulator for the Z80 processor and the peripherals of the ZX Spectrum 48K computer

This software is still pre-release. Feel free to contact me at adigostin@gmail.com for issues with it.

Here's a picture of what the development environment looks like:
